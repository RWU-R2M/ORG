# Potential Sponsorship: Rover to Mars - Become a Crewmate

Dear `COMPANY NAME`,

I am writing on behalf of "Rover to Mars", a student organization which builds robotic vehicles at the University of Applied Sciences Ravensburg Weingarten, with a unique opportunity for collaboration. Our organization encourages students using hands-on experience, targeting the Canadian International Rover Challenge (CIRC). This event is going to be held in Drumheller, Alberta, Canada, from the 9-12th of August 2024. Being one of the largest rover-competitions around the globe, we are thrilled to represent a German team taking part in this event!

We believe `COMPANY NAME` is aligned with our interests with your extensive experience in the `COMPANY SOLUTION` industry. Therefore, we would like to form a partnership with you, to financially support the cost of our rover or even supply our team with parts so that we can use them in the CIRC. As of now, we have financed the rover so far with our own pocket money, but as students, an expensive project like this is not sustainable for us to finance this project and need external support.

Enclosed with this email, you may find our brochure detailing our organization's mission (and where you may find your benefits if you choose to support it), as well as an expense sheet outlining our financial requirements for participating in the CIRC. We would be more than happy to arrange a presentation to further elaborate on our project and answer any questions you may have.

Thank you for considering our proposal. We eagerly anticipate the opportunity to discuss potential collaboration and appreciate your support in helping us achieve our objectives.
Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any inquiries or to schedule a meeting.

Best regards,
`YOUR NAME`
